== DESCRIPTION:

Welcome to s3sync.rb         
--------------------
Home page, wiki, forum, bug reports, etc: http://s3sync.net

This is a ruby program that easily transfers directories between a local
directory and an S3 bucket:prefix. It behaves somewhat, but not precisely, like
the rsync program. In particular, it shares rsync's peculiar behavior that
trailing slashes on the source side are meaningful. See examples below.

One benefit over some other comparable tools is that s3sync goes out of its way
to mirror the directory structure on S3.  Meaning you don't *need* to use s3sync
later in order to view your files on S3.  You can just as easily use an S3
shell, a web browser (if you used the --public-read option), etc.  Note that
s3sync is NOT necessarily going to be able to read files you uploaded via some
other tool.  This includes things uploaded with the old perl version!  For best
results, start fresh!

s3sync runs happily on linux, probably other *ix, and also Windows (except that
symlinks and permissions management features don't do anything on Windows). If
you get it running somewhere interesting let me know (see below)

s3sync is free, and license terms are included in all the source files. If you
decide to make it better, or find bugs, please let me know.

The original inspiration for this tool is the perl script by the same name which
was made by Thorsten von Eicken (and later updated by me). This ruby program
does not share any components or logic from that utility; the only relation is
that it performs a similar task.


Management tasks
----------------
For low-level S3 operations not encapsulated by the sync paradigm, try the
companion utility s3cmd.rb. See README_s3cmd.txt.


About single files
------------------
s3sync lacks the special case code that would be needed in order to handle a
source/dest that's a single file. This isn't one of the supported use cases so
don't expect it to work. You can use the companion utility s3cmd.rb for single
get/puts.


About Directories, the bane of any S3 sync-er
--------------------------------------------- 
In S3 there's no actual concept of folders, just keys and nodes. So, every tool
uses its own proprietary way of storing dir info (my scheme being the best
naturally) and in general the methods are not compatible.

If you populate S3 by some means *other than* s3sync and then try to use s3sync
to "get" the S3 stuff to a local filesystem, you will want to use the
--make-dirs option. This causes the local dirs to be created even if there is no
s3sync-compatible directory node info stored on the S3 side. In other words,
local folders are conjured into existence whenever they are needed to make the
"get" succeed.


About MD5 hashes
----------------
s3sync's normal operation is to compare the file size and MD5 hash of each item
to decide whether it needs syncing.  On the S3 side, these hashes are stored and
returned to us as the "ETag" of each item when the bucket is listed, so it's
very easy.  On the local side, the MD5 must be calculated by pushing every byte
in the file through the MD5 algorithm.  This is CPU and IO intensive!  

Thus you can specify the option --no-md5. This will compare the upload time on
S3 to the "last modified" time on the local item, and not do md5 calculations
locally at all. This might cause more transfers than are absolutely necessary.
For example if the file is "touched" to a newer modified date, but its contents
didn't change. Conversely if a file's contents are modified but the date is not
updated, then the sync will pass over it.  Lastly, if your clock is very
different from the one on the S3 servers, then you may see unanticipated
behavior.


A word on SSL_CERT_DIR:
-----------------------
On my debian install I didn't find any root authority public keys.  I installed
some by running this shell archive: 
http://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de/cvs.cgi/src/etc/ssl.certs.shar
(You have to click download, and then run it wherever you want the certs to be
placed).  I do not in any way assert that these certificates are good,
comprehensive, moral, noble, or otherwise correct.  But I am using them.

If you don't set up a cert dir, and try to use ssl, then you'll 1) get an ugly
warning message slapped down by ruby, and 2) not have any protection AT ALL from
malicious servers posing as s3.amazonaws.com.  Seriously... you want to get
this right if you're going to have any sensitive data being tossed around.
--
There is a debian package ca-certificates; this is what I'm using now.
apt-get install ca-certificates
and then use:
SSL_CERT_DIR=/etc/ssl/certs

You used to be able to use just one certificate, but recently AWS has started
using more than one CA.


Getting started:
----------------
Invoke by typing s3sync.rb and you should get a nice usage screen.
Options can be specified in short or long form (except --delete, which has no 
short form)

ALWAYS TEST NEW COMMANDS using --dryrun(-n) if you want to see what will be
affected before actually doing it. ESPECIALLY if you use --delete. Otherwise, do
not be surprised if you misplace a '/' or two and end up deleting all your
precious, precious files.

If you use the --public-read(-p) option, items sent to S3 will be ACL'd so that
anonymous web users can download them, given the correct URL. This could be
useful if you intend to publish directories of information for others to see.
For example, I use s3sync to publish itself to its home on S3 via the following
command: s3sync.rb -v -p publish/ ServEdge_pub:s3sync Where the files live in a
local folder called "publish" and I wish them to be copied to the URL:
http://s3.amazonaws.com/ServEdge_pub/s3sync/... If you use --ssl(-s) then your
connections with S3 will be encrypted. Otherwise your data will be sent in clear
form, i.e. easy to intercept by malicious parties.

If you want to prune items from the destination side which are not found on the
source side, you can use --delete. Always test this with -n first to make sure
the command line you specify is not going to do something terrible to your
cherished and irreplaceable data.


Updates and other discussion: 
----------------------------- 
The latest version of s3sync should normally be at:
	http://s3.amazonaws.com/ServEdge_pub/s3sync/s3sync.tar.gz 
and the Amazon S3 forums probably have a few threads going on it at any given
time. I may not always see things posted to the threads, so if you want you can
contact me at gbs-s3@10forward.com too.


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* FIX (list of features or problems)

== SYNOPSIS:

Examples: 
---------
(using S3 bucket 'mybucket' and prefix 'pre')
  Put the local etc directory itself into S3
        s3sync.rb  -r  /etc  mybucket:pre
        (This will yield S3 keys named  pre/etc/...)
  Put the contents of the local /etc dir into S3, rename dir:
        s3sync.rb  -r  /etc/  mybucket:pre/etcbackup
        (This will yield S3 keys named  pre/etcbackup/...)
  Put contents of S3 "directory" etc into local dir
        s3sync.rb  -r  mybucket:pre/etc/  /root/etcrestore
        (This will yield local files at  /root/etcrestore/...)
  Put the contents of S3 "directory" etc into a local dir named etc
        s3sync.rb  -r  mybucket:pre/etc  /root
        (This will yield local files at  /root/etc/...)
  Put S3 nodes under the key pre/etc/ to the local dir etcrestore
  **and create local dirs even if S3 side lacks dir nodes**
        s3sync.rb  -r  --make-dirs  mybucket:pre/etc/  /root/etcrestore
        (This will yield local files at  /root/etcrestore/...)

List all the buckets your account owns:
	s3cmd.rb listbuckets

Create a new bucket:
	s3cmd.rb createbucket BucketName

Create a new bucket in the EU:
	s3cmd.rb createbucket BucketName EU
   
Find out the location constraint of a bucket:
   s3cmd.rb location BucketName

Delete an old bucket you don't want any more:
	s3cmd.rb deletebucket BucketName
	
Find out what's in a bucket, 10 lines at a time:
	s3cmd.rb list BucketName 10
	
Only look in a particular prefix:
	s3cmd.rb list BucketName:startsWithThis
	
Look in the virtual "directory" named foo;
lists sub-"directories" and keys that are at this level.
Note that if you specify a delimiter you must specify a max before it.
(until I make the options parsing smarter)
	s3cmd.rb list BucketName:foo/  10  /

Delete a key:
	s3cmd.rb delete BucketName:AKey

Delete all keys that match (like a combo between list and delete):
	s3cmd.rb deleteall BucketName:SomePrefix
	
Only pretend you're going to delete all keys that match, but list them: 
	s3cmd.rb  --dryrun  deleteall  BucketName:SomePrefix
	
Delete all keys in a bucket (leaving the bucket):
	s3cmd.rb deleteall BucketName
	
Get a file from S3 and store it to a local file
	s3cmd.rb get BucketName:TheFileOnS3.txt  ALocalFile.txt
	
Put a local file up to S3 
Note we don't automatically set mime type, etc.
NOTE that the order of the options doesn't change. S3 stays first!
	s3cmd.rb put BucketName:TheFileOnS3.txt ALocalFile.txt


A note about [headers]
----------------------
For some S3 operations, such as "put", you might want to specify certain headers
to the request such as Cache-Control, Expires, x-amz-acl, etc.  Rather than
supporting a load of separate command-line options for these, I just allow
header specification.  So to upload a file with public-read access you could
say:
	s3cmd.rb  put  MyBucket:TheFile.txt  x-amz-acl:public-read

If you don't need to add any particular headers then you can just ignore this
whole [headers] thing and pretend it's not there.  This is somewhat of an
advanced option.


== REQUIREMENTS:

* FIX (list of requirements)

== INSTALL:

sudo gem install ovaskevich-s3sync

Or if you use bundler, you can point to the source repo:

gem 'ovaskevich-s3sync', :git => 'git://github.com/ovaskevich/s3sync.git'


Your environment:
-----------------
s3sync needs to know several interesting values to work right.  It looks for 
them in the following environment variables -or- a s3config.yml file.
In the yml case, the names need to be lowercase (see example file).
Furthermore, the yml is searched for in the following locations, in order:
   $S3CONF/s3config.yml
   $HOME/.s3conf/s3config.yml
   /etc/s3conf/s3config.yml

Required:
	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
	
	If you don't know what these are, then s3sync is probably not the
	right tool for you to be starting out with.
Optional:
	AWS_S3_HOST - I don't see why the default would ever be wrong
   HTTP_PROXY_HOST,HTTP_PROXY_PORT,HTTP_PROXY_USER,HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD - proxy
	SSL_CERT_DIR - Where your Cert Authority keys live; for verification
	SSL_CERT_FILE - If you have just one PEM file for CA verification
	S3SYNC_RETRIES - How many HTTP errors to tolerate before exiting
	S3SYNC_WAITONERROR - How many seconds to wait after an http error
	S3SYNC_MIME_TYPES_FILE - Where is your mime.types file
	S3SYNC_NATIVE_CHARSET - For example Windows-1252.  Defaults to ISO-8859-1.
   AWS_CALLING_FORMAT - Defaults to REGULAR
       REGULAR   # http://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/key
       SUBDOMAIN # http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/key
       VANITY    # http://<vanity_domain>/key  

Important: For EU-located buckets you should set the calling format to SUBDOMAIN
Important: For US buckets with CAPS or other weird traits set the calling format 
to REGULAR

I use "envdir" from the daemontools package to set up my env 
variables easily: http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html
For example:
	envdir /root/s3sync/env /root/s3sync/s3sync.rb -etc etc etc
I know there are other similar tools out there as well.  

You can also just call it in a shell script where you have exported the vars 
first such as:
#!/bin/bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=valueGoesHere
...
s3sync.rb -etc etc etc

But by far the easiest (and newest) way to set this up is to put the name:value
pairs in a file named s3config.yml and let the yaml parser pick them up. There
is an .example file shipped with the tar.gz to show what a yaml file looks like.
Thanks to Alastair Brunton for this addition.

You can also use some combination of .yaml and environment variables, if you
want. Go nuts.
